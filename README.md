# rock-paper-scissors

Made by Aarond Dino. 
Python.

This project was a basic rock, paper, scissors game in python language, run on the CLI with some ASCII art and basic dialogue. It involved practicing the use of coordinating multiple python files, user input, passing global variables, pathing, and some the use of classes to record the live game status.

The codebase includes the main file which calls the two components of the python CLI game, the start screen and the core gameplay, which can be further improved upon to have things like a scoreboard etc.
